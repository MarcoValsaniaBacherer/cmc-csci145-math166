# Homework: web search with word2vec

In this assignment, you will create a search engine that uses both pagerank and word embeddings to find high quality results.

Task 1 is required, Tasks 2 and 3 are extra credit.
Each extra credit is worth up to 3% added to your final score in the class.
For example, if you have an 85% as your final grade,
but complete both extra credits,
your final percentage will be 91%.

**Due date:**
~~Sunday, 29 November~~ Sunday, 6 December at midnight

## Task 1

The file `pagerank.py` contains a completed solution to the pagerank problem.
Recall that we can use this file to find the "highest quality" search results from the https://lawfareblog.com website.

For example, searching for "weapons" gives us:
```

```

Notice that the results for each of these terms do not overlap at all.

In a real search engine, however, we probably want to return results that mention "drones" or "targets" if someone searches for "weapons" since these terms are highly related.
Word vectors give us a tool for doing this.

In particular, we can use the gensim library and pretrained word vectors to find words similar to the search word, and search for those as well.
For example, we can find words related to "weapons" by running the python code
```
>>> import gensim.downloader
>>> vectors = gensim.downloader.load('glove-twitter-25')
>>> vectors.most_similar('weapons')
[('drones', 0.8980589509010315),
 ('drone', 0.8965809345245361),
 ('assault', 0.8937929272651672),
 ('targets', 0.8834593296051025),
 ('firearms', 0.8833326697349548),
 ('weapon', 0.8730441927909851),
 ('hiv', 0.8625047206878662),
 ('laws', 0.8613511323928833),
 ('drug', 0.8555657863616943),
 ('concealed', 0.8548306822776794)
]
```
Notice that both the words "drones" and "targets" appear in this list of similar words.
The list isn't perfect though... "hiv" doesn't seem very similar to "weapons" to me.

Part of the problem is that I'm using a particularly poor model above.
The `glove-twitter-25` model is trained only on twitter data and has only 25 dimensions.
Larger models trained on more data naturally provide better results.

You can find a list of models built-in to gensim [here](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim-data#models),
and there's thousands of other open source models that people have released that can easily be incorporated as well.

**Your Task:**
Modify the `pagerank.py` file so that it also searches for the keywords in the query and the 5 most similar words.
The results of your modified file when searching for "weapons" should look something like:
```
$ python3 pagerank.py --data=./lawfareblog.csv.gz --search_query='weapons'

```
Notice that most of these articles do not mention the word "weapons",
but instead mention the word "drone".

The easiest way to implement this is to modify the `url_satisfies_query` function so that it calls gensim's `most_similar` function on each of the input query words,
and returns `True` if any of those words are in the list.
I recommend using only the 5 most similar words,
as the words quickly become fairly unrelated.

**Submission:**
Upload your completed `pagerank.py` to github,
and update the `README.md` file from your pagerank homework assignment so that all the displayed results are generated from your modified search engine.
(You don't need to redo the results for the `small.csv.gz` file, just the `lawfareblog.csv.gz` file.)

Submit to sakai a link to your github repo.

## Task 2 (Extra Credit): More advanced rankings

There are several problems with the method above for including similar words in our search results.
For example:

1. Some words have lots of very similar words.
   Consider the most similar words for the search "biden":
   ```
   >>> vectors.most_similar('biden')
   [('hillary', 0.9419968128204346),
    ('christie', 0.9419272541999817), 
    ('romney', 0.9377604722976685), 
    ('potus', 0.9371991157531738), 
    ('reid', 0.9328151345252991), 
    ('boehner', 0.9311597347259521), 
    ('clinton', 0.9253027439117432), 
    ('clegg', 0.9072402119636536), 
    ('miliband', 0.9010352492332458), 
    ('zimmerman', 0.8950174450874329)
    ]
   ```
   All of the results above are more similar to "biden" than any word is to "weapons".
   So if we are only looking at the top5 words for everything,
   then some words will get much better matches than others.

1. If someone is searching for "weapons",
   we should probably weight articles about weapons higher than articles about "drones",
   and we should rank articles about both "drones" and "weapons" the highest.
   Our previous method ranks all of these results equally.

One simple method for fixing both of these problems to define a `query_score` for each webpage in addition to the pagerank score `pi`.
This `query_score` would be a real number that depends on both the query and the article's text,
and would be high whenever the query and text are related to each other.
Then the webpage's ranking would be defined by:
```
ranking = pi * query_score
```
Instead of only by the pagerank `pi`.

There are many possible ways to define the query score.
For example, if we define the `query_score` to be 0 when `url_satisfies_query` returns `False` and 1 when it returns `True`,
then this algorithm reduces to the previous algorithm.

A better method is to use the similarity scores using the following pseudocode:
```
score = 0
let S be the set of words similar to the query string
for each word in S:
    let n be the number of times word appears in document
    let word_similarity be the similarity score of word
    score += n * word_similarity**p
```
By adjusting the p hyperparameter, we can control how important the word similarities must be.
A typical p value would be between 30-60, since this will result in scores roughly on a similar scale as the pagerank vectors.
In practice, however, the optimal value would be learned from a dataset using SGD.
There's a famous expression from the early 2000s that goes:

> Google uses data mining the same way that Microsoft uses the if statement.

**Task:**
Implement the "better method" described above.
You will have to modify the `WebGraph.search` function so that it implements the pseudocode described above,
and orders documents according to the `ranking` score instead of according to `pi`.

**Submission:**
Let me know in the sakai submission box that you completed this task,
and I'll look at your code on github and grade it.

## Task 3 (Extra Credit): Custom word vectors

In this task, you will train your own word vectors using gensim.
Training quality word vectors requires a lot of data,
and the lawfareblog dataset does not contain sufficient data by itself.
Instead, I recommend training on all of wikipedia.
You can find instructions for doing that with gensim at:
https://textminingonline.com/training-word2vec-model-on-english-wikipedia-by-gensim

Following these instructions takes about 24-48 hours of compute time on a standard laptop,
and about 20Gb of disk space.

**Task:**
Train your own word vectors, and demonstrate that they work reasonably well by performing analogy evaluations on them.

**Submission:**
Schedule a zoom meeting with me to demonstrate that your trained word vectors work.
